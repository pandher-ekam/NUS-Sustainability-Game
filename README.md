he he # NUS-Sustainability-Game

This is a point and click text based adventure game that takes the user through the typical week of a nus student. It aims to help players gain awareness of some the food choices that they make on a day-to-day basis that can help the environment by minimiseing their carbon footprint.


Currently the game is in early development. UI - UX developers are appreciated as the current look of the game is quite poor.
